### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

I enjoyed lab 5 as I got to do more math related things, which is something I enjoy. The first part
involved finding the area of a rectangle which was simple and nice. The second part involves turning 
the feet to feet and inches which can be helpful for some things I do at home.

* Lab 6

I like lab 6 as it involved a card game which was something I was not expecting. It was fun as this 
was the first time for me replicating a game, or at least the rules of the game. It gave me a look at 
how I can make rules for a game.

* Lab 8

I liked lab 8 because it was really simple. For the first part it was a simple thing saying what kind of a sandwich you had and the next 
one was checking the average of the arguments on the command line. The other thing it made me think of is how I can keep programs like 
this to reuse later as they would be simple to implement.
